##Objective
This lab assignment is designed to modify and implement methods in which uses the interrupts to determine when a button is pressed. The purpose of this lab assignemt is to practice and demonstrate the skills of coding on an MSP430.

##Outcome
The outcome of this lab assignment was not as expected. Given that the assembly part was not comoleted the purpose of it was to implement a state machine onto the MSP430 to utilize the program for a way to return to its staring state.


##How to load
Loading involves first downloading the repo from the Git repository and changing the directory into that folder of "projects".
    1. Change directory into the timerlib file and fun the makefile using make install. Using this command installs the necesary attributes to run the makefile with no errors.
    2. Going back into the project folder then into mainToy includes another makefile in which you can run using make load. At this point, make sure yout MSP430 is properly connected to device.
    3.Run the makefile from the mainToy and the code should load onto thw MSP430.
